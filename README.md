# recipe-app-api
This is my first project using Python's Django REST framework to create an API for food recipes.
I'm also using Docker for the first time, and with the help of AI, I'm still learning the concepts of Dockerization, images, and version control.
However, you can see the progress I've made since creating my first app.

Additionally, I've implemented unit tests for the first time; previously, I was only checking the API's responses in the terminal and Postman.
While I don't claim to know everything, I am actively learning how to write efficient tests. For this project, I'm using PostgreSQL as my database instead of Django's built-in SQLite. 

This is a standard CRUD application, and you can find more details in my commits and documentation.
