# recipe-app-api
This is my first project using Python's Django REST framework to create an API for food recipes. 
I'm also using Docker for the first time, and with the help of online resources, I'm learning about Dockerization, images, and version control. 
You can see the progress I've made since creating my first app.

Additionally, I've implemented GitHub Actions for the first time to understand how it works, although I don't see real use cases for it just yet.

I've also started writing unit tests, which is a new experience for me. In the past, I was only checking the API's responses in the terminal and Postman. While I don't claim to know everything, I am actively learning how to write efficient tests.
For this project, I am using PostgreSQL as my database instead of Django's built-in SQLite.

This is a standard CRUD application, and you can find more details in my commits and documentation.
